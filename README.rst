Just-DNA-Seq Documentation README
=======================================

This is Just-DNA-Seq documentation project on ReadTheDocs:

https://just-dna-seq.readthedocs.io

Documentation files are located in /docs/source

Home page is index.rst

Sections:
getting_started.rst
annotators.rst
filters.rst
working_with_info.rst

Also we need to add the section "Installing Applications" as the exact set of application needed to install in OakVar/OpenCravat for Just-DNA-Seq is outside the scope of OakVar/OpenCravat documentation.

Other files including Python are needed to build ReadTheDocs project, please do not touch them.
