Just-DNA-Seq Documentation
===================================

**Just-DNA-Seq** is a project to facilitate working with human genomes at all levels - from clinical cases to personal curiosity, education and longevity.
We envision the future when genomics is becoming more *available*, *understandable* and *useful* for everybody, especially those interested in life extension and improving human condition.
For this purpose we use `OpenCravat framework <https://opencravat.org/>`_ to integrate *annotators* which are tools or databases accumulating what we actually know about the genome - genes, their influence on health or drug response, polygenic risk scores and so on.

Check out the :doc:`getting_started` section for further information, including
the section :ref:`assemblies` to understand whether you have the appropriate genome assembly.

   This project is under active development.
