Just-DNA-Seq Documentation
===================================

**Just-DNA-Seq** is a project to facilitate working with human genomes at all levels - from clinical cases to personal curiosity, education and longevity.
We envision the future when genomics is becoming more *available*, *understandable* and *useful* for everybody, especially those interested in life extension and improving human condition.
For this purpose we use `OakVar framework <https://oakvar.com>`_ to integrate *annotators* which are tools or databases accumulating what we actually know about the genome - genes, their influence on health or drug response, polygenic risk scores and so on.

We created **Oakvar-Longevity** which is a module of OakVar. It annotates user genome with longevity associated gene variants using the longevitymap annotator, and provides longevity PRS, variants, drugs and major risks(oncorisk) reports with longevity-combinedreporter.

Check out the :doc:`getting_started` section for further information, including
the section :ref:`assemblies` to understand whether you have the appropriate genome assembly.
