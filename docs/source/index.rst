Just-DNA-Seq Documentation
===================================

**Just-DNA-Seq** is a project to facilitate working with human genomes at all levels - from clinical cases to personal curiosity, education and longevity.
We envision the future when genomics is becoming more *available*, *understandable* and *useful* for everybody, especially those interested in life extension and improving human condition.

For this purpose we use `OakVar framework <https://oakvar.com>`_ to integrate *annotators* which are tools or databases accumulating what we actually know about the genome - genes, their influence on health or drug response, polygenic risk scores and so on.

We created the **Oakvar-Longevity** module for OakVar. It annotates user genome with longevity associated gene variants using the longevitymap annotator, and provides the longevity PRS, variants, drugs and major risks (oncorisk) reports with the longevity-combined reporter.

Check out the :doc:`getting_started` section for further information, including the :ref:`assemblies` section to understand whether you have the appropriate genome assembly.

**NOTE:** This project is under active development.
